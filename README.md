# geollm
A repo to collect together experiments on using LLMs across the technology platform.
We want to explore building out a UK GeoAgent for use in many of our projects but 
there is still lots of research to be done before we get there. The idea of this 
repo is for us to have a single place where we can gather together different experiments 
and reflect on what works and what doesnt.

## Experiments 

-  demoland_llm_server: Our first exploration in to using LLMs, this folder contains the 
server code and the agent code for the work done with demoland
